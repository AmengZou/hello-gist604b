# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Ameng Zou  
**Date:** October 26, 2025

## What I Learned
- How to create and organize repositories on GitHub  
- How Issues and labels support collaboration  
- Why documentation is essential in open source GIS projects  

## Challenges and Solutions
At first I was confused about how to create folders in GitHub’s web interface.  
I learned that typing `foldername/filename` automatically creates the folder.

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub helps me manage code and collaborate in open source hydrology and GIS modeling projects.  
It’s also a professional portfolio platform that showcases my technical work.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating `hello-gist604b` mirrors how open source projects work:  
contributors create repositories, make improvements, and share them publicly.
